# Weakly-Supervised

In this project we aim to explore a weakly supervised approach for tumor lozalization.


### Main Idea
* 3D Lesions on brain from BRATS dataset.
* Creating classification labels from segmentation masks.
* Training SoA network for classification.
* Applying Gradcam like methods for localizing (+BBox).
* Evaluating with IoU like metrics.

### Dataset

Modified BRATS. To Do
